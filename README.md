## ✨ What is Orange Shift?

**Orange Shift** is a lightweight, browser-based game built in pure HTML, JavaScript and CSS — no dependencies, no build tools, no nonsense.

You are a small orange sphere.  
You bounce through a procedurally generated maze.  
Avoid the dark agents. Touch the white ones to shift them orange.  
Every orange shift changes the balance.

**Find the exit. Don’t lose your light.**

> _Maybe it was a glitch in the system._  
> _Maybe it was you._  
> _Now the color spreads — changing everything it touches._  
> _Find your way before the darkness catches up._

## 🧪 Origin & Context

Orange Shift was created as part of a **Vibe Coding Experiment** with **Gemini 2.5 Pro (Canvas Mode)** — an interface that lets humans and AI build ideas *together* in real time.

I (👋 [Mirko Appel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mirko-appel/)) am an **innovation consultant and AI trainer**, helping brands and communicators explore creative applications of artificial intelligence.

This project was a playful exploration of:
- Conversational coding with a language model
- Rapid prototyping in the browser
- Minimalist game mechanics + emergent complexity

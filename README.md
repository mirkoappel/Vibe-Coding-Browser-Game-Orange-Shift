## What is Orange Shift?

**Orange Shift** is a lightweight, browser-based game built with HTML, JavaScript, CSS and Three.js — no other dependencies, no build tools, just a single HTML-File.

You are a small orange sphere.  
You bounce through a procedurally generated maze.  
Avoid the dark agents. Touch the white ones to shift them orange.  
Every orange shift changes the balance.

**Find the exit. Don’t lose your light.**

> _Maybe it was a glitch in the system._

## Origin & Context

Orange Shift was created as part of a Vibe Coding Experiment with Gemini 2.5 Pro (Canvas Mode) — an interface that enables humans and AI to build ideas together in real time. The game was developed by Mirko Appel, an innovation consultant and AI trainer helping brands and communicators explore creative applications of artificial intelligence.

This project was a playful exploration of:
- Conversational coding with a language model
- Rapid prototyping in the browser
- Minimalist game mechanics + emergent complexity
